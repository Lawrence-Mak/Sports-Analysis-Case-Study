# Introduction

The purpose of this case study is to identify and analyize the differences between a multitude of variables to find trends and patterns within the Los Angeles Clippers team situated within the National Basketball Association.

The patterns and trends identified provides athletes and coaches with objective information that helps them understand performance. 
This process is underpinned by systematic observation, which provides valid, reliable and detailed information relating to performance.

The variables this case study will cover are:
<ul>
  <li> Winning Percentage vs. Average Attendance
    <li> Payroll vs. Average Attendance
      <li> Team Payroll vs. Winning Percentages
        <li> Which coefficients have an effect on salary?
          </ul>         
It is important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. 

### Winning Percentage vs. Average Attendance

The first two variables we will be comparing are winning percentage and attendance. The question is - does having a higher attendance mean the team has a higher possibility to win?

<br> To find this, we will need to use data from our <a href = "https://github.com/Lawrence-Mak/SportsAnalysis/blob/main/SportsAnalysisDataFile.xlsx"> database </a>

<br> We are able to vizualise trends and patterns by creating a graph.

This graph illustrates the connection between the LA Clippers winning percentage versus their home game attendance average from 2000 to 2018. From the trendline observed, it is evident that there is a positive, linear correlation between the two variables. In other words, when the LA Clippers win more games, more fans will come out to home games to support them. Having a high R^2 value also proves that there is a high correlation between the two variables, and the 63.7% of the variation in the output variable can be explained by the input variables.

Diving deeper, we can hypothesize that demand analysis explains the observed linear trend, with the premise that home game attendance is extremely closely tied to ticket demand, or ticket sales. 
There are several factors that might influence the number of tickets required. The demand curve would be affected by, for example, drafting, purchasing, or trading for a more attractive roster, having a better coach, having a more interesting style of play, an increase in ads for the LA Clippers, or a change in the preference or income of individuals in the region. The demand curve would shift rightwards in these instances, ceteris paribus, and there would be a bigger amount sought at each price.

To illustrate this, the 2011 - 2012 Clippers team can be used as an example – The season where the Clippers drafted Chris Paul, who immediately turned the clippers into one of the leagues most entertaining and dangerous teams. Before this trade, from 2000 – 2011, the Clippers had an average win rate of 39%. After this trade, from 2013 - 2018 the team had an average win rate of 63.5%. This is a huge increase, and the improvement was reflected in their home game attendance, and the rate at which tickets were bought. Of course, Chris Paul was not the only contributing factor to such a high average win rate, Blake Griffin, fellow All-star, and Captain of the Clippers also pushed sales in the 2013 season, averaging 18.0 points per game and 8.3 rebounds per game in 32.5 minutes per game. He and Chris Paul led the Los Angeles Clippers to a 56–26 record, leading to the highest win percentage in the last ten years of Clippers History. 

On the other hand, the 2000-2001 Clippers season seems to be the largest outlier in the positive Winning percentage vs Attendance trend. Even though they had a 38%-win rate, they didn’t have nearly as many fans as some of the seasons where the team had even worse win rates. After finishing with the worst record the previous season, the Clippers decided it was time to rebuild, drafting Darius Miles in the third pick, alongside other young talents such as Keyon Dooling and Corey Magette. Having such a young team with no prospects to back them up really hurt the Clippers Attendance, as nobody even knew who these players were. Ultimately, leading to one of the Clippers worst selling and performing years.
